Beside being the most eminent Macedonian band, they were also one of the most important acts of the former Yugoslav Rock scene. "Leb i sol" is a traditional greeting which literally translates to "bread and salt". It is often used as an expression of spite or determination; e.g. "I will eat bread and salt if I have to, but I will not give in!". More commonly, distinguished visitors to villages and communities would be offered a piece of home-baked bread and a dip of salt as a traditional welcome, which is where the name of the band really came from. Their music combined elements of rock, jazz fusion and ethnic Macedonian music.
